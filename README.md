# 🎤 Rapper Game

A unique battle royale game inspired by simulationvoid's square battle concept, featuring your favorite rappers in an epic showdown!

## 🎮 Game Concept

Inspired by the viral simulationvoid videos, this game transforms the original square battle concept into an engaging rapper-themed experience. Instead of colored squares, players battle as their favorite rappers in a dynamic arena where:

- Rappers move randomly and bounce off walls
- A shrinking purple barrier adds pressure to the gameplay
- Weapons (guns and knives) spawn randomly
- Each rapper can attack others regardless of their "team"
- Dynamic music system plays the active rapper's track after each kill

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Mechanics
- **Movement System**: Unity2D with Rigidbody2D for physics-based movement
- **Battle Arena**: Shrinking boundary system using colliders
- **Weapon System**: 
  - Guns: Projectile-based combat
  - Knives: Close-range instant kills
  - Weapon pickups and drops

### Dynamic Features
- **Music System**:
  - Each rapper has their signature track
  - Music changes based on the most recent kill
  - Smooth audio transitions between tracks

- **Visual Effects**:
  - Custom rapper sprites replacing the original squares
  - Death animations and effects
  - UI displays for kills and current track

### Engagement Features
- Monthly rapper rotation system
- Real-time leaderboard
- Social sharing capabilities
- Custom rapper selection
